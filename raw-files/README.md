# Raw Files 
Annotation was done using [Brat Rapid Annotation Tool](https://brat.nlplab.org/). Annotation details are stored in *.ann* files in standoff format.

### 1. News articles
Due to copyright issues, original news articles are not made available. Instead URL link to each news articles are provided along with the corresponding *.ann* file. Pre-processing codes to extract each articles are made available.

### 2. Augmented Data
In order to increase the size of the annotations, a number of sentences are augmented using the following approach:
1. Trigger word replacement using FrameNet.
2. Event argument replacement

For augmented data, original text are made available along with their corresponding *.ann* files.
