Oil dips as U.S.-China trade war intensifies further.

Oil prices dropped on Monday as new tariffs on both the U.S. and China trade dispute took effect, adding to concerns over an already-gloomy global economic outlook and lower demand for crude.

U.S. Crude Oil WTI Futures slipped 0.02% to $55.09 by 12:34 AM ET (04:34 GMT). International Brent Oil Futures gained 0.44% to $58.99.

Over the weekend, the Sino-U.S. trade war intensified again as U.S. tariffs on 15% on Chinese goods including footwear, smart watches and flat-panel televisions took effect. Chinese tariffs of between 5% to 10% on a range of U.S. goods also kicked in.
